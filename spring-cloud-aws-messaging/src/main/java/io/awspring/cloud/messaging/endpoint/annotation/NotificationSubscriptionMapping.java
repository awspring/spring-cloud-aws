/**
 * Spring Web MVC request mapping that supports Amazon SNS HTTP endpoint subscriptions
 * using the Spring Controller model. This annotation configures a method to receive
 * notification subscriptions using a
 * {@link org.springframework.cloud.aws.messaging.endpoint.NotificationStatus} object and
 * to confirm them using the
 * {@link org.springframework.cloud.aws.messaging.endpoint.NotificationStatus#confirmSubscription()}
 * method.
 *
 * A notification controller will be mapped to a particular url inside the application
 * context. The mapped url must be configured inside the Amazon Web Service platform as a
 * subscription. Before receiving any notification itself a controller must confirm the
 * subscription. After confirming the subscription, the controller will start to receive
 * notifications using an annotated
 * {@link org.springframework.cloud.aws.messaging.endpoint.annotation.NotificationMessageMapping}
 * method.
 *
 * The mapping of the controller to a URL has to be done using a
 * {@link org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping} annotation. Typically
 * one controller class will contain all the methods used to confirm a subscription,
 * receive notifications and receive the unsubscribe message.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> Currently this annotation does not allow an explicit mapping of controller
 * methods to URLs. Therefore this annotation can only be used in one controller class
 * that has an class level @RequestMapping annotation.
