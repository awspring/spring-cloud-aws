== Migration from 2.x to 3.x

[WARNING]
====
Migration guide is work in progress.

Properties that have changed from 2.x to 3.x are listed below:

[cols="2*", options="header", width=100%, %autowidth]
|===
|Version 2.x
|Version 3.x

|`cloud.aws.credentials.access-key`
|`spring.cloud.aws.credentials.access-key`

|`cloud.aws.credentials.secret-key`
|`spring.cloud.aws.credentials.secret-key`

|`cloud.aws.region.static`
|`spring.cloud.aws.region.static`

|`aws.paramstore.region`
|`spring.cloud.aws.parameterstore.region`

|`aws.secretsmanager.region`
|`spring.cloud.aws.secretsmanager.region`

|`management.metrics.export.cloudwatch.*`
|`management.cloudwatch.metrics.export.*`
|===

Properties that have been removed in 3.x are listed below:

* Cognito Properties

** `spring.cloud.aws.security.cognito.app-client-id`
** `spring.cloud.aws.security.cognito.user-pool-id`
** `spring.cloud.aws.security.algorithm`
** `spring.cloud.aws.security.region`
** `spring.cloud.aws.security.enabled`

The same behaviour can be enabled using Spring Boot integration with Spring Security OAuth2 support:

[source,properties]
----
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=http://127.0.0.1:4566/us-east-1_f865f8979c4d4361b6af703db533dbb4
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=http://127.0.0.1:4566/us-east-1_f865f8979c4d4361b6af703db533dbb4/.well-known/jwks.json
----

The example above set the URIs to LocalStack's Cognito Server.

=== Parameter store migration

In 2.x, parameter store items were resolved using a combination of the following settings:

* `aws.paramstore.prefix` (defaulted to `/config`)
* `aws.paramstore.defaultContext` for shared config items
* `aws.paramstore.name` for application-specific config items

For example, if all you had done was set `aws.paramstore.enabled=true`, and your `spring.application.name` was `my-service`, then parameter store items could be resolved from either `/config/application` (for shared config items) and `/config/my-service` (for application specific config items)

If you overrode one or more of the settings, then there could potentially be other prefixes where the application would look for parameters.

In 3.x, the prefix is defined by the `spring.config.import` property, and is no longer made up of a "prefix" or "name" component. For example, if reading properties for a service called `my-service`, the parameter store should be configured like this:

```
# Still needed for other parts of spring boot
spring.application.name=my-service
# Needed for spring-cloud-aws-starter-parameter-store
spring.config.import=aws-parameterstore:/config/my-service/
```

To load multiple parameters from multiple paths, separate their names by `;`. For example, this would replicate a 2.x configuration that utilized both shared config items and application specific config items

```
spring.config.import=aws-parameterstore:/config/application/;/config/my-service/
```

NOTE: The paths specified after the `aws-parameterstore:` scheme are used as-is for resolving parameter names. If you want parameter names to be separated with a slash between the prefix and property name, make sure to add a trailing slash to the prefix.

=== SQS Integration migration

In Spring Cloud AWS 2.x, when a collection of objects was passed as an argument to send or receive payloads, the framework serialized and deserialized the list in a single message.
In Spring Cloud AWS 3.x, the way to send and receive object collections has changed, see <<sqs-send-message>>.
