=== Integrating your Spring Cloud application with the AWS Parameter Store

Spring Cloud provides support for centralized configuration, which can be read and made available as a regular Spring
`PropertySource` when the application is started. The Parameter Store Configuration allows you to use this mechanism
with the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html[AWS Parameter Store].

Simply add a dependency on the `spring-cloud-starter-aws-parameter-store-config` starter module to activate the support.
The support is similar to the support provided for the Spring Cloud Config Server or Consul's key-value store:
configuration parameters can be defined to be shared across all services or for a specific service and can be
profile-specific. Encrypted values will be decrypted when retrieved.

All configuration parameters are retrieved from a common path prefix, which defaults to `/config`. From there shared
parameters are retrieved from a path that defaults to `application` and service-specific parameters use a path that
defaults to the configured `spring.application.name`. You can use both dots and forward slashes to specify the names
of configuration keys. Names of activated profiles will be appended to the path using a separator that defaults to an
underscore.

That means that for a service called `my-service` the module by default would find and use these parameters:
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|parameter key
|Spring property
|description

|`/config/application/cloud.aws.stack.name`
|`cloud.aws.stack.name`
|Shared by all services that have the Configuration support enabled. Can be overridden with a service- or profile-specific property.

|`/config/application_production/cloud.aws.stack.name`
|`cloud.aws.stack.name`
|Shared by all services that have the Configuration support enabled and have a `production` Spring profile activated.
Can be overridden with a service-specific property.

|`/config/my-service/cloud/aws/stack/auto`
|`cloud.aws.stack.auto`
|Specific to the `my-service` service. Note that slashes in the key path are replaced with dots.

|`/config/my-service_production/cloud/aws/stack/auto`
|`cloud.aws.stack.auto`
|Specific to the `my-service` service when a `production` Spring profile is activated.
|===

Note that this module does not support full configuration files to be used as parameter values like e.g. Spring Cloud Consul does:
AWS parameter values are limited to 4096 characters, so we support individual Spring properties to be configured only.

You can configure the following settings in a Spring Cloud `bootstrap.properties` or `bootstrap.yml` file
(note that relaxed property binding is applied, so you don't have to use this exact syntax):
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|property
|default
|explanation

|`aws.paramstore.prefix`
|`/config`
|Prefix indicating first level for every property loaded from the Parameter Store.
Value must start with a forward slash followed by one or more valid path segments or be empty.

|`aws.paramstore.defaultContext`
|`application`
|Name of the context that defines properties shared across all services

|`aws.paramstore.profileSeparator`
|`_`
|String that separates an appended profile from the context name. Can only contain
dots, dashes, forward slashes, backward slashes and underscores next to alphanumeric characters.

|`aws.paramstore.failFast`
|`true`
|Indicates if an error while retrieving the parameters should fail starting the application.

|`aws.paramstore.name`
|the configured value for `spring.application.name`
|Name to use when constructing the path for the properties to look up for this specific service.

|`aws.paramstore.enabled`
|`true`
|Can be used to disable the Parameter Store Configuration support even though the auto-configuration is on the classpath.

|`aws.paramstore.region`
|`eu-central-1`
|Can be used to configure region AWSSimpleSystemsManagementClients.

[TIP]
====
In order to find out which properties are retrieved from AWS Parameter Store on application startup,
turn on `DEBUG` logging on `io.awspring.cloud.paramstore.AwsParamStorePropertySource` class.

[source,indent=0]
----
logging.level.io.awspring.cloud.paramstore.AwsParamStorePropertySource=debug
----
====

In `spring-cloud` `2020.0.0` (aka Ilford), the bootstrap phase is no longer enabled by default. In order
enable it you need an additional dependency:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap</artifactId>
  <version>{spring-cloud-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

However, starting at `spring-cloud-aws` `2.3`, allows import default aws' parameterstore keys
(`spring.config.import=aws-parameterstore:`) or individual keys
(`spring.config.import=aws-parameterstore:config-key;other-config-key`)

=== IAM Permissions
Following IAM permissions are required by Spring Cloud AWS:

[cols="2"]
|===
| Get parameter from specific path
| `ssm:GetParametersByPath`

|===

Sample IAM policy granting access to Parameter Store:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ssm:GetParametersByPath",
            "Resource": "yourArn"
        }
    ]
}
