	=== SNS support
Amazon SNS is a publish-subscribe messaging system that allows clients to publish notification to a particular topic. Other
interested clients may subscribe using different protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, e-mail or an Amazon SQS queue to receive the messages.

The next graphic shows a typical example of an Amazon SNS architecture.

image::sns-overview.png[SNS Overview]

Spring Cloud AWS supports Amazon SNS by providing support to send notifications with a `NotificationMessagingTemplate` and
to receive notifications with the HTTP/HTTPS endpoint using the Spring Web MVC `@Controller` based programming model. Amazon
SQS based subscriptions can be used with the annotation-driven message support that is provided by the Spring Cloud AWS messaging module.

==== Sending a message
The `NotificationMessagingTemplate` contains two convenience methods to send a notification. The first one specifies the
destination using a `String` which is going to be resolved against the SNS API. The second one takes no destination
argument and uses the default destination. All the usual send methods that are available on the `MessageSendingOperations`
are implemented but are less convenient to send notifications because the subject must be passed as header.

[NOTE]
====
Currently only `String` payloads can be sent using the `NotificationMessagingTemplate` as this is the expected
type by the SNS API.

----
import com.amazonaws.services.sns.AmazonSNS;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import io.awspring.cloud.messaging.core.NotificationMessagingTemplate;

public class SnsNotificationSender {

	private final NotificationMessagingTemplate notificationMessagingTemplate;

	@Autowired
	public SnsNotificationSender(AmazonSNS amazonSns) {
		this.notificationMessagingTemplate = new NotificationMessagingTemplate(amazonSns);
	}

	public void send(String subject, String message) {
		this.notificationMessagingTemplate.sendNotification("physicalTopicName", message, subject);
	}
}
----

This example constructs a new `NotificationMessagingTemplate` by passing an `AmazonSNS` client as argument. In the `send`
method the convenience `sendNotification` method is used to send a `message` with `subject` to an SNS topic. The
destination in the `sendNotification` method is a string value that must match the topic name defined on AWS. This value
is resolved at runtime by the Amazon SNS client. Optionally a `ResourceIdResolver` implementation can be passed to the
`NotificationMessagingTemplate` constructor to resolve resources by logical name when running inside a CloudFormation stack.
(See <<Managing cloud environments>> for more information about resource name resolution.)

It is recommended to use the XML messaging namespace to create `NotificationMessagingTemplate` as it will automatically
configure the SNS client to setup the default converter.

<aws-messaging:notification-messaging-template id="notificationMessagingTemplate" />

==== Annotation-driven HTTP notification endpoint
SNS supports multiple endpoint types (SQS, Email, HTTP, HTTPS), Spring Cloud AWS provides support for HTTP(S) endpoints.
SNS sends three type of requests to an HTTP topic listener endpoint, for each of them annotations are provided:

* Subscription request -> `@NotificationSubscriptionMapping`
* Notification request -> `@NotificationMessageMapping`
* Unsubscription request -> `@NotificationUnsubscribeMapping`

HTTP endpoints are based on Spring MVC controllers. Spring Cloud AWS added some custom argument resolvers to extract
the message and subject out of the notification requests.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/topicName")
public class NotificationTestController {

	@NotificationSubscriptionMapping
	public void handleSubscriptionMessage(NotificationStatus status) throws IOException {
		//We subscribe to start receive the message
		status.confirmSubscription();
	}

	@NotificationMessageMapping
	public void handleNotificationMessage(@NotificationSubject String subject, @NotificationMessage String message) {
		// ...
	}

	@NotificationUnsubscribeConfirmationMapping
	public void handleUnsubscribeMessage(NotificationStatus status) {
		//e.g. the client has been unsubscribed and we want to "re-subscribe"
		status.confirmSubscription();
	}
}
----

[CAUTION]
====
Currently it is not possible to define the mapping URL on the method level therefore the `RequestMapping` must
be done at type level and must contain the full path of the endpoint.
====

This example creates a new Spring MVC controller with three methods to handle the three requests listed above. In order
to resolve the arguments of the `handleNotificationMessage` methods a custom argument resolver must be registered. The
XML configuration is listed below.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<mvc:annotation-driven>
	<mvc:argument-resolvers>
		<ref bean="notificationResolver" />
	</mvc:argument-resolvers>
</mvc:annotation-driven>

<aws-messaging:notification-argument-resolver id="notificationResolver" />
----

The `aws-messaging:notification-argument-resolver` element registers three argument resolvers:
`NotificationStatusHandlerMethodArgumentResolver`, `NotificationMessageHandlerMethodArgumentResolver`,
and `NotificationSubjectHandlerMethodArgumentResolver`.

=== Using CloudFormation
Amazon SQS queues and SNS topics can be configured within a stack and then be used by applications. Spring Cloud AWS
also supports the lookup of stack-configured queues and topics by their logical name with the resolution to the physical
name. The example below shows an SNS topic and SQS queue configuration inside a CloudFormation template.

[source,json,indent=0]
----
"LogicalQueueName": {
	"Type": "AWS::SQS::Queue",
	"Properties": {
	}
},
"LogicalTopicName": {
	"Type": "AWS::SNS::Topic",
	"Properties": {
  	}
}
----

The logical names `LogicalQueueName` and `LogicalTopicName` can then be used in the configuration and in the application
as shown below:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<aws-messaging:queue-messaging-template default-destination="LogicalQueueName" />

<aws-messaging:notification-messaging-template default-destination="LogicalTopicName" />
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@SqsListener("LogicalQueueName")
public void receiveQueueMessages(Person person) {
	// Logical names can also be used with messaging templates
	this.notificationMessagingTemplate.sendNotification("anotherLogicalTopicName", "Message", "Subject");
}
----

When using the logical names like in the example above, the stack can be created on different environments without any
configuration or code changes inside the application.


=== IAM Permissions
Following IAM permissions are required by Spring Cloud AWS:

[cols="2"]
|===
| To publish notification to topic
| `sns:Publish`

| To publish notification you will also need
| `sns:ListTopics`

| To use Annotation-driven HTTP notification endpoint
| `sns:ConfirmSubscription`


|===

Sample IAM policy granting access to SNS:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sns:Publish",
                "sns:ConfirmSubscription"
            ],
            "Resource": "yourArn"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sns:ListTopics",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
