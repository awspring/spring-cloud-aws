= Spring Cloud for Amazon Web Services

Spring Cloud for Amazon Web Services, part of the Spring Cloud umbrella project, eases the integration with hosted Amazon Web Services. It offers a convenient way to interact with AWS provided services using well-known Spring idioms and APIs, such as the messaging or caching API. Developers can build their application around the hosted services without having to care about infrastructure or maintenance.

= Checking out and building
To check out the project and build it from source, do the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-aws.git
cd spring-cloud-aws
mvn package
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter out of memory errors during the build, increase
available heap and permgen for Maven:

-------------------------------------------
MAVEN_OPTS='-XX:MaxPermSize=258m -Xmx1024m'
-------------------------------------------

To build and install jars into your local Maven cache:

-----------
mvn install
-----------

= Building documentation
Documentation can be built by activating the `docs`profile in the maven
build. If there is an ruby error like

--------------------------------------------------------------
LoadError: no such file to load -- asciidoctor
--------------------------------------------------------------

then the user must install the _asciidoctor_ gem and set the environment
variable `GEM_HOME`to the ruby gem folder. For example:

-------------------------------------------------------------
  # Get gem info
  gem environment

  export GEM_HOME=<PATH FOR GEM ENVIRONMENT>

-------------------------------------------------------------

= Using IntelliJ IDEA
Spring Cloud AWS development is done with
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA]. In order to create all
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] project files, you have to
import the file within idea as a maven project.

_Note:_ Please make sure to revert all changes in the .idea config file
directory, as the maven plugin overwrites the configuration files kept
in the scm.

= Running integration tests

Spring Cloud AWS contains a test-suite which runs integration tests to
ensure compatibility with the Amazon Web Services. In order to run the
integration tests, the build process has to create different resources
on the Amazon Webservice platform (Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS
instances, Amazon S3 Buckets, Amazon SQS Queues). Creating these
resources takes time and costs money, because every instance creation is
charged with a one hour usage. Therefore Spring Cloud AWS does not
execute the integration tests by default.

In order to execute the integration tests you have to create two
configuration files that configure the necessary parameters to build the
environment.

Please create a new file named access.properties. This file must contain
three properties named accessKey,secretKey and rdsPassword. These two
properties accessKey and secretKey are account/user specific and should
never be shared to anyone. To retrieve these settings you have to open
your account inside the AWS console and retrieve them through the
https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials[Security
Credentials Page]. _Note:_ In general we recommend that you use an
https://aws.amazon.com/iam/[Amazon IAM] user instead of the account
itself. The last password rdsPassword is used to access the database
inside the integration tests. This password has a minimum length of 8
characters.

An example file will look like this

-------------------------------------------
cloud.aws.credentials.accessKey=ilaugsjdlkahgsdlaksdhg
cloud.aws.credentials.secretKey=aöksjdhöadjs,höalsdhjköalsdjhasd+
rdsPassword=someVerySecretPassword
-------------------------------------------

Also you have to create another file named mail.properties which will
provide the sender and recipient mail address to test the
https://aws.amazon.com/ses/[Amazon Simple E-Mail Service]. These two
addresses must be verified for the Amazon SES Service.

An example file will have the following contents

----------------------------
senderAddress=foo@bar.com
recipientAddress=baz@buz.com
----------------------------

After creating both files and storing them outside the project (or
inside the project, they are ignored in git) you have to provide the
configuration directory when running the build. Providing these
configuration settings will automatically execute the integration tests.

To build with the integration tests you must execute

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mvn verify -Dels.config.dir=/Users/foo/config/dir
(on windows you will also need a leading slash before the drive letter e.g. /C:/users/foo/config/dir)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The integration test will create an
https://aws.amazon.com/de/cloudformation/[Amazon Web Services
CloudFormation] stack and execute the tests. The stack is destroyed
after executing the tests (either successful or failed) to ensure that
there are no unnecessary costs.

= Costs of integration tests
The costs for one integration test run should not be more than 0.40 $
per hour (excl. VAT).


= Developing using Amazon Web Services

During development it might be time-consuming to run the integration
tests regularly. In order to create a stack only once, and reuse them
for the tests run, you have to create the stack manually using the
template found in /spring-cloud-aws-integration-test/src/test/resources.
You will need to create the stack with the name "IntegrationTestStack"
to ensure that the integration tests will re-use the stack.

== Contributing

:spring-cloud-build-branch: master

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor License Agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/code-of-conduct.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-dependencies-parent/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).

=== Checkstyle

Spring Cloud Build comes with a set of checkstyle rules. You can find them in the `spring-cloud-build-tools` module. The most notable files under the module are:

.spring-cloud-build-tools/
----
└── src
    ├── checkstyle
    │   └── checkstyle-suppressions.xml <3>
    └── main
        └── resources
            ├── checkstyle-header.txt <2>
            └── checkstyle.xml <1>
----
<1> Default Checkstyle rules
<2> File header setup
<3> Default suppression rules

==== Checkstyle configuration

Checkstyle rules are *disabled by default*. To add checkstyle to your project just define the following properties and plugins.

.pom.xml
----
<properties>
<maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnError>true</maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnError> <1>
        <maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnViolation>true
        </maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnViolation> <2>
        <maven-checkstyle-plugin.includeTestSourceDirectory>true
        </maven-checkstyle-plugin.includeTestSourceDirectory> <3>
</properties>

<build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin> <4>
                <groupId>io.spring.javaformat</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-javaformat-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
            <plugin> <5>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>

    <reporting>
        <plugins>
            <plugin> <5>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </reporting>
</build>
----
<1> Fails the build upon Checkstyle errors
<2> Fails the build upon Checkstyle violations
<3> Checkstyle analyzes also the test sources
<4> Add the Spring Java Format plugin that will reformat your code to pass most of the Checkstyle formatting rules
<5> Add checkstyle plugin to your build and reporting phases

If you need to suppress some rules (e.g. line length needs to be longer), then it's enough for you to define a file under `${project.root}/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` with your suppressions. Example:

.projectRoot/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppresions.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE suppressions PUBLIC
		"-//Puppy Crawl//DTD Suppressions 1.1//EN"
		"https://www.puppycrawl.com/dtds/suppressions_1_1.dtd">
<suppressions>
	<suppress files=".*ConfigServerApplication\.java" checks="HideUtilityClassConstructor"/>
	<suppress files=".*ConfigClientWatch\.java" checks="LineLengthCheck"/>
</suppressions>
----

It's advisable to copy the `${spring-cloud-build.rootFolder}/.editorconfig` and `${spring-cloud-build.rootFolder}/.springformat` to your project. That way, some default formatting rules will be applied. You can do so by running this script:

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/.editorconfig -o .editorconfig
$ touch .springformat
```

=== IDE setup

==== Intellij IDEA

In order to setup Intellij you should import our coding conventions, inspection profiles and set up the checkstyle plugin.
The following files can be found in the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/tree/master/spring-cloud-build-tools[Spring Cloud Build] project.

.spring-cloud-build-tools/
----
└── src
    ├── checkstyle
    │   └── checkstyle-suppressions.xml <3>
    └── main
        └── resources
            ├── checkstyle-header.txt <2>
            ├── checkstyle.xml <1>
            └── intellij
                ├── Intellij_Project_Defaults.xml <4>
                └── Intellij_Spring_Boot_Java_Conventions.xml <5>
----
<1> Default Checkstyle rules
<2> File header setup
<3> Default suppression rules
<4> Project defaults for Intellij that apply most of Checkstyle rules
<5> Project style conventions for Intellij that apply most of Checkstyle rules

.Code style

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/{spring-cloud-build-branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-code-style.png[Code style]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Code style`. There click on the icon next to the `Scheme` section. There, click on the `Import Scheme` value and pick the `Intellij IDEA code style XML` option. Import the `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/intellij/Intellij_Spring_Boot_Java_Conventions.xml` file.

.Inspection profiles

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/{spring-cloud-build-branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-inspections.png[Code style]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Inspections`. There click on the icon next to the `Profile` section. There, click on the `Import Profile` and import the `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/intellij/Intellij_Project_Defaults.xml` file.

.Checkstyle

To have Intellij work with Checkstyle, you have to install the `Checkstyle` plugin. It's advisable to also install the `Assertions2Assertj` to automatically convert the JUnit assertions

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/{spring-cloud-build-branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-checkstyle.png[Checkstyle]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Other settings` -> `Checkstyle`. There click on the `+` icon in the `Configuration file` section. There, you'll have to define where the checkstyle rules should be picked from. In the image above, we've picked the rules from the cloned Spring Cloud Build repository. However, you can point to the Spring Cloud Build's GitHub repository (e.g. for the `checkstyle.xml` : `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle.xml`). We need to provide the following variables:

- `checkstyle.header.file` - please point it to the Spring Cloud Build's, `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle/checkstyle-header.txt` file either in your cloned repo or via the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle-header.txt` URL.
- `checkstyle.suppressions.file` - default suppressions. Please point it to the Spring Cloud Build's, `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` file either in your cloned repo or via the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-build-tools/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` URL.
- `checkstyle.additional.suppressions.file` - this variable corresponds to suppressions in your local project. E.g. you're working on `spring-cloud-contract`. Then point to the `project-root/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` folder. Example for `spring-cloud-contract` would be: `/home/username/spring-cloud-contract/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml`.

IMPORTANT: Remember to set the `Scan Scope` to `All sources` since we apply checkstyle rules for production and test sources.
