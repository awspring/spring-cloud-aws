== Using Amazon Web Services

Amazon provides a https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/[Java SDK] to issue requests for the all services provided by the
https://aws.amazon.com[Amazon Web Service] platform. Using the SDK, application developers still have to integrate the
SDK into their application with a considerable amount of infrastructure related code. Spring Cloud AWS provides application
developers already integrated Spring-based modules to consume services and avoid infrastructure related code as much as possible.
The Spring Cloud AWS module provides a module set so that application developers can arrange the dependencies based on
their needs for the particular services. The graphic below provides a general overview of all Spring Cloud AWS modules along
with the service support for the respective Spring Cloud AWS services.

image::overview.png[Overview]

* *Spring Cloud AWS Core* is the core module of Spring Cloud AWS providing basic services for security and configuration
setup. Developers will not use this module directly but rather through other modules. The core module provides support for
cloud based environment configurations providing direct access to the instance based https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[EC2]
metadata and the overall application stack specific https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[CloudFormation] metadata.
* *Spring Cloud AWS Context* delivers access to the https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Simple Storage Service] via the Spring
resource loader abstraction. Moreover developers can send e-mails using the https://aws.amazon.com/ses/[Simple E-Mail Service]
and the Spring mail abstraction. Further the developers can introduce declarative caching using the Spring caching support
and the https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/[ElastiCache] caching service.
* *Spring Cloud AWS JDBC* provides automatic datasource lookup and configuration for the https://aws.amazon.com/rds/[Relational Database Service]
which can be used with JDBC or any other support data access technology by Spring.
* *Spring Cloud AWS Messaging* enables developers to receive and send messages with the https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/[Simple Queueing Service] for
point-to-point communication. Publish-subscribe messaging is supported with the integration of the https://aws.amazon.com/sns/[Simple Notification Service].
* *Spring Cloud AWS Parameter Store Configuration* enables Spring Cloud applications to use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html[AWS Parameter Store]
as a Bootstrap Property Source, comparable to the support provided for the Spring Cloud Config Server or Consul's key-value store.
* *Spring Cloud AWS Secrets Manager Configuration* enables Spring Cloud applications to use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html[AWS Secrets Manager]
as a Bootstrap Property Source, comparable to the support provided for the Spring Cloud Config Server or Consul's key-value store.


== Basic setup
Before using the Spring Cloud AWS module developers have to pick the dependencies and configure the Spring Cloud AWS module.
The next chapters describe the dependency management and also the basic configuration for the Spring AWS Cloud project.

=== Spring Cloud AWS maven dependency management
Spring Cloud AWS module dependencies can be used directly in https://maven.apache.org[Maven] with a direct configuration
of the particular module. The Spring Cloud AWS module includes all transitive dependencies for the Spring modules and
also the Amazon SDK that are needed to operate the modules. The general dependency configuration will look like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.awspring.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-aws-context</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-cloud-aws-version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Different modules can be included by replacing the module name with the respective one (e.g. `spring-cloud-aws-messaging`
instead of `spring-cloud-aws-context`)

=== Amazon SDK dependency version management

Amazon SDK is released more frequently than Spring Cloud AWS. If you need to use newer version of AWS SDK than one configured by Spring Cloud AWS
add AWS SDK BOM to dependency management section making sure it is declared before any other BOM dependency that configures AWS SDK dependencies.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
			<artifactId>aws-java-sdk-bom</artifactId>
			<version>${aws-java-sdk.version}</version>
			<type>pom</type>
			<scope>import</scope>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Amazon SDK configuration
The Spring Cloud AWS configuration is currently done using custom elements provided by Spring Cloud AWS namespaces.
JavaConfig will be supported soon. The configuration setup is done directly in Spring XML configuration files
so that the elements can be directly used. Each module of Spring Cloud AWS provides custom namespaces to allow the modular
use of the modules. A typical XML configuration to use Spring Cloud AWS is outlined below:


[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:aws-context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/cloud/aws/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/cloud/aws/context
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/cloud/aws/context/spring-cloud-aws-context.xsd">

           <aws-context:context-region region="..."/>
</beans>
----

[TIP]
====
On application startup, for its internal purposes Spring Cloud AWS performs a check if application runs in AWS cloud environment
by using `EC2MetadataUtils` class provided by AWS SDK. Starting from version 1.11.678, AWS SDK logs a warning message with exception when this check is made outside of AWS environment.
This warning message can be hidden by setting `ERROR` logging level on `com.amazonaws.util.EC2MetadataUtils` class.

[source,indent=0]
----
logging.level.com.amazonaws.util.EC2MetadataUtils=error
----

If `ContextInstanceDataAutoConfiguration` is enabled, but application is not running in EC2 environment, AWS SDK logs a warning message with an exception which adds potentially unnecessary noise to application logs.
This warning message can be hidden by setting `ERROR` logging level on `com.amazonaws.internal.InstanceMetadataServiceResourceFetcher` class.

[source,indent=0]
----
logging.level.com.amazonaws.internal.InstanceMetadataServiceResourceFetcher=error
----
====

==== SDK credentials configuration
In order to make calls to the Amazon Web Service the credentials must be configured for the the Amazon SDK. Spring Cloud AWS
provides support to configure an application context specific credentials that are used for _each_ service call for requests done
by Spring Cloud AWS components, with the exception of the Parameter Store and Secrets Manager Configuration.
Therefore there must be *exactly one* configuration of the credentials for an entire application context.

[TIP]
====
The `com.amazonaws.auth.DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain` is used by all the clients if there is no dedicated credentials
 provider defined. This will essentially use the following authentication information

* use the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* use the system properties `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`
* use the user specific profile credentials file
* use ECS credentials if the `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` environment variable is set
* use the instance profile credentials (see below)
====

Based on the overall credentials policy there are different options to configure the credentials. The possible ones are described in
the following sub-chapters.

===== Simple credentials configuration
Credentials for the Amazon SDK consist of an access key (which might be shared) and a secret key (which must *not* be shared). Both
security attributes can be configured using the XML namespaces for each Amazon SDK service created by the Spring Cloud AWS
module. The overall configuration looks like this

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<beans ...>
  <aws-context:context-credentials>
   <aws-context:simple-credentials access-key="AKIAIO" secret-key="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7M" />
  </aws-context:context-credentials>
</beans>
----

[CAUTION]
====
The access-key and secret-key should be externalized into property files (e.g. Spring Boot application configuration)
and not be checked in into the source management system.
====

===== Instance profile configuration
An https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/instance-profiles.html[instance profile configuration] allows to assign
a profile that is authorized by a role while starting an EC2 instance. All calls made from the EC2 instance are then authenticated
with the instance profile specific user role. Therefore there is no dedicated access-key and secret-key needed in the configuration.
The configuration for the instance profile in Spring Cloud AWS looks like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<beans ...>
	<aws-context:context-credentials>
 		<aws-context:instance-profile-credentials/>
 	</aws-context:context-credentials>
</beans>
----

===== Mixing both security configurations
In some cases it is useful to combine both authentication strategies to allow the application to use the instance profile
with a fallback for an explicit access-key and secret-key configuration. This is useful if the application is tested inside
EC2 (e.g. on a test server) and locally for testing. The next snippet shows a combination of both security configurations.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
 <beans ...>
    <aws-context:context-credentials>
        <aws-context:instance-profile-credentials/>
        <aws-context:simple-credentials access-key="${accessKey:}" secret-key="${secretKey:}"/>
    </aws-context:context-credentials>
 </beans>
----

[TIP]
====
The access-key and secret-key are defined using a placeholder expressions along with a default value to avoid bootstrap
errors if the properties are not configured at all.
====

===== Parameter Store and Secrets Manager Configuration credentials and region configuration
The Parameter Store and Secrets Manager Configuration support uses a bootstrap context to configure a default `AWSSimpleSystemsManagement`
client, which uses a `com.amazonaws.auth.DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain` and `com.amazonaws.regions.DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain`.
If you want to override this, then you need to
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Edgware.SR2/multi/multi__spring_cloud_context_application_context_services.html#_customizing_the_bootstrap_configuration[define your own Spring Cloud bootstrap configuration class]
with a bean of type `AWSSimpleSystemsManagement` that's configured to use your chosen credentials and/or region provider.
Because this context is created when your Spring Cloud Bootstrap context is created, you can't simply override the bean
in a regular `@Configuration` class.

==== Region configuration
Amazon Web services are available in different https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html[regions]. Based
on the custom requirements, the user can host the application on different Amazon regions. The `spring-cloud-aws-context`
module provides a way to define the region for the entire application context.

===== Explicit region configuration
The region can be explicitly configured using an XML element. This is particularly useful if the region can not be automatically
derived because the application is not hosted on a EC2 instance (e.g. local testing) or the region must be manually overridden.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<beans ...>
  	<aws-context:context-region region="eu-west-1"/>
</beans>
----

[TIP]
====
It is also allowed to use expressions or placeholders to externalize the configuration and ensure that the region can
be reconfigured with property files or system properties.
====

===== Automatic region configuration
If the application context is started inside an EC2 instance, then the region can automatically be fetched from the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html[instance metadata] and therefore must
not be configured statically. The configuration will look like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
   <beans ...>
     <aws-context:context-region auto-detect="true" />
   </beans>
----

===== Service specific region configuration
A region can also be overridden for particular services if one application context consumes services from different regions.
The configuration can be done globally like described above and configured for each service with a region attribute.
The configuration might look like this for a database service (described later)

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
 <beans ...>
  <aws-context:context-region region="eu-central-1" />
  <jdbc:data-source ... region="eu-west-1" />
 </beans>
----

[NOTE]
====
While it is theoretically possible to use multiple regions per application, we strongly recommend to write applications that
are hosted only inside one region and split the application if it is hosted in different regions at the same time.
====

==== Spring Boot auto-configuration
Following the Spring Cloud umbrella project, Spring Cloud AWS also provides dedicated Spring Boot support. Spring Cloud
AWS can be configured using Spring Boot properties and will also automatically guess any sensible configuration based on
the general setup.

===== Maven dependencies
Spring Cloud AWS provides a dedicated module to enable the Spring Boot support. That module must be added to the general
maven dependency inside the application. The typical configuration will look like this

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.awspring.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-aws-autoconfigure</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-cloud-version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Additional dependencies to enable particular features like messaging and JDBC have to be added. Spring Cloud AWS will
only configure classes that are available in the Spring Boot application's classpath.

===== Configuring credentials
Spring Boot provides a standard way to define properties with property file or YAML configuration files. Spring Cloud
AWS provides support to configure the credential information with the Spring Boot application configuration files.

By default Spring Cloud AWS configures https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html[DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain] to resolve AWS credentials.

If other credentials providers are configured, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html[DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain] is not used and Spring Cloud AWS configures following credentials chain:

1. `AWSStaticCredentialsProvider` if `cloud.aws.credentials.access-key` is provided
2. `EC2ContainerCredentialsProviderWrapper` if `cloud.aws.credentials.instance-profile` is set to `true`
3. `ProfileCredentialsProvider` if `cloud.aws.credentials.profile-name` is provided

Spring Cloud AWS provides the following properties to configure the credentials setup for the whole application.

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|property
|example
|description

|cloud.aws.credentials.access-key
|AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
|The access key to be used with a static provider

|cloud.aws.credentials.secret-key
|wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
|The secret key to be used with a static provider

|cloud.aws.credentials.instance-profile
|true
|Configures an instance profile credentials provider with no further configuration

|cloud.aws.credentials.profile-name
|default
|The name of a configuration profile in the specified configuration file

|cloud.aws.credentials.profile-path
|`~/.aws/credentials`
|The file path where the profile configuration file is located. Defaults to `~/.aws/credentials` if value is not provided
|===

===== Configuring region
Like for the credentials, the Spring Cloud AWS module also supports the configuration of the region inside the Spring
Boot configuration files. The region can be automatically detected using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/regions/DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain.html[DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain] or explicitly configured (e.g. in case of local tests
against the AWS cloud).

The properties to configure the region are shown below

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|property
|example
|description

|cloud.aws.region.static
|eu-west-1
|Configures a static region for the application. Possible regions are (currently) us-east-1, us-west-1, us-west-2,
eu-west-1, eu-central-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-northeast-1, sa-east-1, cn-north-1 and any custom region
configured with own region meta data

|===

Each integration can now be configured to have a specific region. If region is specified this way it takes priority over default or static region. For example:

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|property
|example
|description

|cloud.aws.sqs.region
|eu-west-1
|Configures a region that SQS integration will use.

|===

===== Enabling integrations

Each integration can be enabled or disabled through a property. By default, all integrations are enabled except `ContextInstanceDataAutoConfiguration`:

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|property
|example
|description

|cloud.aws.sqs.enabled
|false
|Disables SQS integration autoconfiguration.
|===


===== Configuring endpoints
For each integrated AWS service you can configure Spring Cloud AWS to use a custom endpoint using configuration properties. For example:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
cloud.aws.s3.endpoint=http://localhost:4566
cloud.aws.sqs.endpoint=http://localhost:4566
cloud.aws.rds.endpoint=http://localhost:4566
----

Using custom endpoint can be especially useful when using https://github.com/localstack/localstack[Localstack] in integration tests or integrating with AWS compatible 3rd party services like https://min.io/[MinIO].

===== Configuring client configuration

For some AWS service integrations you can configure Spring Cloud AWS to use custom `ClientConfiguration`.

To override the default `ClientConfiguration` used by all integrations, create a bean of type `ClientConfiguration` with a name `com.amazonaws.ClientConfiguration.BEAN_NAME`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
class CustomAwsConfiguration {

    @Bean(name = "com.amazonaws.ClientConfiguration.BEAN_NAME")
	ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration() {
		ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration= new ClientConfiguration();
		clientConfiguration.setProxyHost(proxyHost);
		clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(proxyPort);
		clientConfiguration.setProxyUsername(proxyUserName);
		clientConfiguration.setProxyPassword(proxyPassword);
		return clientConfiguration;
	}
}
----

It's also possible to provide `ClientConfiguration` for particular integration by defining a bean of type `ClientConfiguration` and a name specific to the integration:

[cols="2"]
|===
| SQS
| `sqsClientConfiguration`

| SNS
| `snsClientConfiguration`

| SES
| `sesClientConfiguration`

| RDS
| `rdsClientConfiguration`

| ElastiCache
| `elastiCacheClientConfiguration`

| CloudWatch
| `cloudWatchClientConfiguration`

|===

For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
class CustomSqsConfiguration {

    @Bean
    ClientConfiguration sqsClientConfiguration() {
        ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration= new ClientConfiguration();
		clientConfiguration.setProxyHost(proxyHost);
		clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(proxyPort);
		clientConfiguration.setProxyUsername(proxyUserName);
		clientConfiguration.setProxyPassword(proxyPassword);
		return clientConfiguration;
    }
}
----

== Cloud environment
Applications often need environment specific configuration information, especially in changing environments like in the
Amazon cloud environment. Spring Cloud AWS provides a support to retrieve and use environment specific data inside the
application context using common Spring mechanisms like property placeholder or the Spring expression language.

=== Retrieving instance metadata
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html[Instance metadata] are available inside an
EC2 environment. The metadata can be queried using a special HTTP address that provides the instance metadata. Spring Cloud
AWS enables application to access this metadata directly in expression or property placeholder without the need to call
an external HTTP service.

==== Enabling instance metadata support with XML
The instance metadata retrieval support is enabled through an XML element like the standard property placeholder in Spring.
The following code sample demonstrates the activation of the instance metadata support inside an application context.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
   <beans ...>
     	<aws-context:context-instance-data />
   </beans>
----

[TIP]
====
Instance metadata can be retrieved without an authorized service call, therefore the configuration above does not require
any region or security specific configuration.
====

==== Enabling instance metadata support with Java
The instance metadata can also be configured within a Java configuration class without the need for an XML configuration.
The next example shows a typical Spring `@Configuration` class that enables the instance metadata with the
`io.awspring.cloud.context.config.annotation.EnableInstanceData`

[source,java,indent=0]
----
  @Configuration
  @EnableContextInstanceData
  public static class ApplicationConfiguration {
  }
----

==== Enabling instance metadata support in Spring Boot
The instance metadata is available in a Spring Boot application as a property source if the application
is running on an EC2 instance and `cloud.aws.instance.data.enabled` property is set to `true`.

==== Using instance metadata
Instance metadata can be used in XML, Java placeholders and expressions. The example below demonstrates the usage of
instance metadata inside an XML file using placeholders and also the expression referring to the special variable `environment`

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<beans ...>
 <bean class="io.awspring.cloud....SimpleConfigurationBean">
	<property name="value1" value="#{environment.ami-id}" />
	<property name="value2" value="#{environment.hostname}" />
	<property name="value3" value="${instance-type}" />
	<property name="value4" value="${instance-id}" />
 </bean>
</beans>
----

Instance metadata can also be injected with the Spring `org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value` annotation
directly into Java fields. The next example demonstrates the use of instance metadata inside a Spring bean.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
   @Component
   public class ApplicationInfoBean {

       @Value("${ami-id:N/A}")
       private String amiId;

       @Value("${hostname:N/A}")
       private String hostname;

       @Value("${instance-type:N/A}")
       private String instanceType;

       @Value("${services/domain:N/A}")
       private String serviceDomain;
   }

----

[NOTE]
====
Every instance metadata can be accessed by the key available in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html[instance metadata service]
Nested properties can be accessed by separating the properties with a slash ('/').
====

==== Using instance user data
Besides the default instance metadata it is also possible to configure user data on each instance. This user data is retrieved and
parsed by Spring Cloud AWS. The user data can be defined while starting an EC2 instance with the application. Spring Cloud AWS
expects the format `<key>:<value>;<key>:<value>` inside the user data so that it can parse the string and extract the key value pairs.

The user data can be configured using either the management console shown below or a https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/[CloudFormation template].

image::cloud-environment-user-data.png[User data in the management console]


A CloudFormation template snippet for the configuration of the user data is outlined below:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
   ...
   "Resources": {
    "ApplicationServerInstance": {
   	 "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
   	 "Properties": {
   	  "ImageId": "ami-6a56b81d",
   	  "UserData": {
   	     "Fn::Base64": "data1:value1;data2:value2"
   	   },
   	  "InstanceType": "t1.micro",
   	 }
   }
   ...
----

The user data can be accessed directly in the application context like the instance metadata through placeholders
or expressions.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Component
public class SecondConfigurationBean {

	@Value("${data1}")
	private String firstDataOption;

	@Value("${data2}")
	private String secondDataOption;
}
----

==== Using instance tags
User configured properties can also be configured with tags instead of user data. Tags are a global concept in the context
of Amazon Web services and used in different services. Spring Cloud AWS supports instance tags also across different
services. Compared to user data, user tags can be updated during runtime, there is no need to stop and restart
the instance.

[TIP]
====
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html[User data] can also be used to execute scripts
on instance startup. Therefore it is useful to leverage instance tags for user configuration and user data to execute scripts
on instance startup.
====

Instance specific tags can be configured on the instance level through the management console outlined below and
like user data also with a CloudFormation template shown afterwards.

image::cloud-environment-instance-tags.png[Instance data in the management console]

A CloudFormation template snippet for the configuration of the instance tags is outlined below:


[source,json,indent=0]
----
...
"Resources": {
	"UserTagAndUserDataInstance": {
		"Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
		"Properties": {
			"ImageId": "ami-6a56b81d",
		  	"InstanceType": "t1.micro",
		  	"Tags": [
			{
				"Key": "tag1",
			  	"Value": "tagv1"
			},
			{
				"Key": "tag3",
			  	"Value": "tagv3"
			},
			{
				"Key": "tag2",
			  	"Value": "tagv2"
			},
			{
				"Key": "tag4",
				"Value": "tagv4"
			}
			]
		}
	}
}
...
----

To retrieve the instance tags, Spring Cloud AWS has to make authenticated requests and therefore it will need the region
and security configuration before actually resolving the placeholders. Also because the instance tags are not available while starting
the application context, they can only be referenced as expressions and not with placeholders. The `context-instance-data`
element defines an attribute `user-tags-map` that will create a map in the application context for the name. This map
can then be queried using expression for other bean definitions.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
 <beans ...>
  <aws-context:context-instance-data user-tags-map="instanceData" />
 </beans>
----

A java bean might resolve expressions with the `@Value` annotation.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
 public class SimpleConfigurationBean {

 	@Value("#{instanceData.tag1}")
 	private String value1;

 	@Value("#{instanceData.tag2}")
 	private String value2;

 	@Value("#{instanceData.tag3}")
 	private String value3;

 	@Value("#{instanceData.tag4}")
 	private String value4;
 }
----

==== Configuring custom EC2 client
In some circumstances it is necessary to have a custom EC2 client to retrieve the instance information. The
`context-instance-data` element supports a custom EC2 client with the `amazon-ec2` attribute. The next
example shows the use of a custom EC2 client that might have a special configuration in place.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<beans ...>

  <aws-context:context-credentials>....</aws-context:context-credentials>
  <aws-context:context-region ... />
  <aws-context:context-instance-data  amazon-ec2="myCustomClient"/>

  <bean id="myCustomClient" class="com.amazonaws.services.ec2.AmazonEC2Client">
	...
  </bean>
</beans>
----

==== Injecting the default EC2 client
If there are user tags configured for the instance data (see above) Spring Cloud AWS configures an EC2 client with
the specified region and security credentials. Application developers can inject the EC2 client directly into their code using the `@Autowired` annotation.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class ApplicationService {

	private final AmazonEC2 amazonEc2;

	@Autowired
	public ApplicationService(AmazonEC2 amazonEc2) {
		this.amazonEc2 = amazonEc2;
	}
}

== Messaging
Spring Cloud AWS provides https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/[Amazon SQS] and https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/[Amazon SNS] integration
that simplifies the publication and consumption of messages over SQS or SNS. While SQS fully relies on the messaging API
introduced with Spring 4.0, SNS only partially implements it as the receiving part must be handled differently for
push notifications.

=== Configuring messaging
Before using and configuring the messaging support, the application has to include the respective module dependency
into the Maven configuration. Spring Cloud AWS Messaging support comes as a separate module to allow the modularized use
of the modules.

==== Maven dependency configuration

The Spring Cloud AWS messaging module comes as a standalone module and can be imported with the following dependency declaration:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>io.awspring.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-aws-messaging</artifactId>
	<version>{spring-cloud-version}</version>
