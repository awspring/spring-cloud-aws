== Spring Modulith Integration

Spring Cloud AWS comes with externalized events

Integration with https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith[Spring Modulith] provides capability to send externalized events to SNS and SQS. Read more about externalizing events in https://docs.spring.io/spring-modulith/reference/events.html#externalization[Spring Modulith Reference Guide].

=== SNS

Maven coordinates, using <<index.adoc#bill-of-materials, Spring Cloud AWS BOM>>:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.awspring.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-aws-modulith-events-sns</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The logical routing key will be used as SNS message group id. When routing key is set, requires SNS to be configured as a FIFO topic with content based deduplication enabled.

=== SQS

Maven coordinates, using <<index.adoc#bill-of-materials, Spring Cloud AWS BOM>>:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.awspring.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-aws-modulith-events-sqs</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The logical routing key will be used as SQS message group id. When routing key is set, requires SQS queue to be configured as a FIFO queue.
